# student_movement_analysis
Project aims at improving the quality of E-education over a local network, through one-to-many Video communication. We are making it more analysis-oriented by using in it technologies like Facial Detection using Deep Learning, real-time Feedback using Charts and Alert systems, etc. At the end, based on the data received by the ML Model, we can show the general attentiveness of all the students in the class to the teacher, highlighting the durations of the lecture where the students felt the most boredom or where most students had doubts, giving the lecturer an analysis on his/her performance and helping him in furtehr improving the course. Besides these features, the students and teachers, both would have a dashboard - where their past performance would be stored and also, they can add a to-do list for them to finish for a particular day.
